# To-Do List App with Python

This project is a simple command-line To-Do List application.  
The user can add tasks, view them, mark them as completed, and delete them through a text-based menu.

I created this project as my first step in learning Python and as an introduction to the world of IT and software development. I plan to improve it over time as I learn more.

---

## Why I built this
I built this project to practice writing a complete CLI program from start to finish.
My main focus was building a clear menu flow, handling tasks in memory, and keeping the code readable.

---

## What I learned
- How to design a simple CLI menu and keep the user flow clear
- How to manage a list of tasks (add / show / complete / delete) in a clean way
- Where the weak points are (input validation, structure), and what to improve next

---

## What is this project?
The main purpose of this app is to manage a basic list of tasks.  
The user can:

- Create new tasks  
- See all existing tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks  
- Exit the program through a menu  

My goal with this project is not to build a perfect app, but to have a working, simple program that I can use to practice and gradually improve.

---

## How to run

After starting the program, a simple text-based menu is shown.  
The user can choose options by entering the corresponding number.

To run the app locally:

```bash
python todo.py
```

## Features (current version)

The current version includes:

1. Add a new task

2. Display all tasks

3. Mark tasks as completed

4. Delete tasks

5. Exit the program via the menu

This is a first working version that I will improve step by step.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required at the moment.
You only need a working Python 3 installation to run the script.

---

## Future improvements (Roadmap)

This is an early version of the app, and I plan to extend and improve it as I continue learning Python. Some ideas for future features:

1. Save tasks to a file (for example using a JSON file) so that they persist after closing the program

2. Add a date (and maybe time) for each task

3. Build a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to make the app more user-friendly

4. Refactor the code into functions or classes to improve structure and readability

---

## Known Issues

The app is still under active development, and there are some known limitations and issues:

- Not all invalid user inputs are handled gracefully yet; in some cases the program may behave unexpectedly

- Tasks are currently stored only in memory and are lost when the program exits

- The code can be refactored to be shorter, cleaner, and more modular

I keep these points here on purpose as a reminder of what I want to improve in future versions.

---

## Technologies used

- Programming language: Python

- IDE: Spyder

In the future I might also try to work with other editors or IDEs (like VS Code) on this project.

---

## Project status

This is an initial, simple version of the app.
It still has bugs and a lot of room for improvement, but that is exactly the point: I want to use this project as a playground to practice Python, learn better coding practices, and gradually turn a very basic script into a more polished application.

For me, this To-Do List is not just a small tool — it is also a record of my learning journey in programming.
